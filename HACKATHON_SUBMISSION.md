# ResiliBot: Autonomous Incident Response Agent

## AWS AI Agent Hackathon 2025 Submission

---

## üéØ Inspiration

The inspiration for ResiliBot came from a critical pain point experienced by DevOps and SRE teams worldwide: **incident response fatigue**.

### The Problem We Observed:

- **Manual incident response** takes an average of 15-45 minutes per incident
- Engineers are pulled from deep work for routine issues
- Human error during high-pressure situations leads to extended downtime
- On-call engineers experience burnout from repetitive troubleshooting
- Companies lose an average of **$5,600 per minute** during downtime

### The Vision:

We envisioned an autonomous agent that could:

- **Think like an experienced SRE** - analyzing symptoms, correlating data, and identifying root causes
- **Act safely and intelligently** - executing remediation with human oversight for risky operations
- **Learn from incidents** - generating detailed postmortems to prevent future occurrences
- **Operate 24/7** - providing consistent, instant response regardless of time or day

The breakthrough came when we realized Amazon Bedrock with Claude 3 Sonnet could power an intelligent agent capable of reasoning through complex infrastructure issues, making ResiliBot not just an automation tool, but a true **autonomous incident response partner**.
